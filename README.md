This is a cleanroom implementation of NIST SP 800-232, Ascon-based crypto primitives.
I implemented it from scratch using

1. The [spec](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-232) from NIST
2. The NIST LWC process final round [submission](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/finalist-round/updated-spec-doc/ascon-spec-final.pdf) from the Ascon team

You probably shouldn't use this code, but here are two reasons you might:

1. The LICENSE is pretty permissive
2. I'm typically amenable to signing contributor license agreements (if needed) to merge this into your project
